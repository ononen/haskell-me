## Believe the type

Everything in Haskell has a type.
Haskell has type inference.
A type is a kind of label that every expression has.
`::` is read as "has type of".
Functions also have types.
The `[Char]` type is synonymous with `String`.

common types:

* Int: is bounded.
* Integer: is not bounded.
* Float: a real floating point with single precision.
* Double: a real floating point with double precision.
* Bool: True False
* Char: It's denoted by single quotes.
* The empty tuple `()` is alse a type which can only have a single value
